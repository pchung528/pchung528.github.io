	<h4>What is the difference between margin, border, and padding?</h4>
		<p>
			The margin refers to the space around the element.  We can use the margin to adjust our html elements closer to or farther from each other.  The border refers to the edge of the element, and it is possible to amke it visible through utilizing the border property.  Padding refers to the spacing between the content and the border.  It is possible to adjust this value with CSS to move the border closer to or farther from the content.
